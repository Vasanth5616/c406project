Activity: File Systems in Linux


Use an EC2 amazonlinux instance to complete this activity.

Start by creating a folder to store the memory reports and open the new folder.
mkdir memory_report
cd memory_report

Create a file that lists all of the files in the home folder, sorted by size with the largest file on the top. Name the file homefiles_sorted.txt.
du ~ -a | sort -k1,1nr > homefiles_sorted.txt
less homefiles_sorted.txt

Repeat the task for all files on the system.
sudo du / -a | sort -k1,1nr > allfiles_sorted.txt
less allfiles_sorted.txt

How large are the files you just created?
du . -ha # actual sizes used
ls -la # size is "apparent" size, not actual
The h option is for human readable and a is for all files.

Next, look at how much room is left in the file system. Save the results to a file named filesystems.txt.
df -h > filesystems.txt

The following command tars all files with the .txt extension into a new file named memory.tar.
tar -cvf memory.tar *.txt
tar -tvf memory.tar
The t is short for --list.

Now turn the tar into a gzip. Gzip is a tool for compressing a file. We can use it to compress the tar, a common task in Linux.
gzip memory.tar

Look at the storage size of the compression and note that it is smaller than the original files.
du . -ha

Delete the original files and extract the compressed tarball. Look at your disk file usage again.
rm *.txt 
du . -ha

Decompress the gzip file with gunzip, and then extract (-x) the tar and examine the size again.
gunzip memory.tar.gz
tar -xvf memory.tar
du . -ha

Examine the memory to be sure it is compressed. Finally, uncompress it again with -z.
tar -czvf memory.tar.gz *.txt
du . -ha
tar -xzvf memory.tar.gz
du . -ha
