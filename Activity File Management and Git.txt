 Activity: File Management and Git

Part A: Managing Files and Folders

Create a folder in your home directory using your name as the name of the folder.

mkdir <yourname>
By convention, angle brackets are used to indicate placeholder text. The brackets should not be included in the name of the new folder.

Move to this folder:

cd <yourname>
Create an empty file:

touch file
Create a new folder in the same location called myfolder:

mkdir myfolder
Move the empty file you created to the new folder:

mv file myfolder/
The / is not required, but it is a safer practice to include it.

Without the /, if the directory myfolder does not exist, the command will rename file to myfolder.
Create a backup of your file:

cp -p myfolder/file file.bkp
Remove the myfolder directory:

rm -rf myfolder
Go back to your home directory:

cd ~

Part B: Working with Git


Clone the repository at https://github.com/The-Software-Guild/pss-orderbook-deploy/ :

git clone https://github.com/TheAcademy/pss-orderbook-deploy/
Go to the newly created "pss-orderbook-deploy" directory:

cd pss-orderbook-deploy
Navigate to the folder src/linux_activities/Activity2:

cd src/linux_activities/Activity2

Searching Files
Display the contents of the file stock_investments.txt:

cat stock_investments.txt
Each line represents an investment in a given stock.
Display the five first lines of the file:

head -5 stock_investments.txt
Display the five last lines of the file:

tail -5 stock_investments.txt
How many lines contain the word GOOG?

grep GOOG stock_investments.txt | wc -l
How many lines contain the word T?

grep -wc T stock_investments.txt
The -w flag is for word match.
List the files that contain the word SPY in any letter case:

grep -lir spy .
List the files that do not contain the word spy:

grep -lvri spy .
Find all files containing the word "data" in their name:

find . -type f -name *data*
Find folders named error:

find . -type d -name error
Change permissions on all files that contain the word "data" so that the files are read-only for group and other.

sudo find . -type f -name "*data*" -exec chmod 744 {} \;
The exec allows you to execute a command on the results of find.

Locate and remove write permission for all users on the file named WFC/data.txt:

chmod -w WFC/data.txt
